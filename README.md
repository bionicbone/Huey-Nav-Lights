Huey-Nav-Lights
===============

PIC controller project to control navigation lights on a scale huey helicopter.

The project also incorporates low voltage indicators using the navigation lights, 
RC switched Search Light and on-board control for Tail Gyro to reduce the number 
of RC channel required.

Written using mikroBasic PRO for PIC

The code has good comments throughout so you should be able to work out what
is going on at all times. In fact, its probably fair to say its more a PIC
Controller tutorial than project code.

For those without "mikroBasic PRO for PIC" installed the key file is: Huey 450.mbas
which can be viewed with any text editor.

Breadboard example of project can be seen on YouTube here:

Feel free to use this code for any personal project(s), 
commercial projects must gain written permission.

Enjoy...
